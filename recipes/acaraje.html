    <h1>Chef Dana Tough's Acaraje</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These African-inspired fritters are made with dried beans that are fermented. The batter is whipped just before frying to create a delicate, fluffy interior. This distant relative of falafel is served with savory yogurt and harissa sauce, making for a dipping sauce that's both fiery and cooling. Acarajé makes for a great meatless protein on a salad but can also be enjoyed on its own as an appetizer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sea salt</li>
        <li>2 cups dried white beans</li>
        <li>¼ yellow onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 small cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground caraway seeds</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat water and 1 tablespoon sea salt together in a pot over medium heat until salt is dissolved and brine is heated, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and cool brine to 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix beans, onion, garlic, coriander, cumin, and caraway seeds together in an air-tight container. Pour brine over bean mixture. Cover container tightly and let sit at room temperature until liquid is beginning to bubble from the gasses, about 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Drain brine from beans mixture, reserving the brine.</li>
        <li>Blend bean mixture in a food processor, adding just enough brine to make acaraje mixture the consistency of thick hummus. Store blended bean mixture in an air-tight container at room temperature for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place acaraje mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat until fluffy.</li>
        <li>Dip a tablespoon into the hot oil to assure the acaraje mixture doesn't stick to the tablespoon. Scoop acaraje with the coated tablespoon and gently drop acaraje mixture into the hot oil; repeat process until about 6 are frying at 1 time.</li>
        <li>Cook acaraje in the hot oil, flipping occasionally for even cooking, until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per batch. Transfer acaraje to a paper towel-lined plate; season with sea salt.</li>
    </ol>
